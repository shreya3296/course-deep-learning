Some examples: if 10% of the bootstrapped models predict $\\hat{y} = 0$ with the remaining 90% predicting $\\hat{y}=1$, then the $PPD=0.1$. When a bagged prediction's $PPD=0$, all predictions are compatible (i.e. all bootstrapped probabilities for that test observation are on the same side of $\\hat{p}=0.5$). Likewise, when the $PPD=0.5$, half of the bootstrapped predictions for that test observation are $\\hat{y}=0$, and the other half are $\\hat{y}=1$. After calculating your $PPD$ values for all test observations, you should have $n=2000$ $PPD$ values (i.e. one for each test observation).\n",

(If you'd like to learn more about abstain models, you can read more [here](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJxF73R9tX).)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore how your resulting test accuracies might change by using your bootstrapped prediction results from question 1.5 for an **abstain bagging model** (i.e. a bootstrap aggregated model where some test observations are simply not predicted based on a given $PPD$ threshold). You can make your abstain model *stricter* by using smaller $PPD$ threshold values.\n",

    "[Return to contents](#contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be prone to overfitting, where they learn specific patterns present in the training data, but the patterns do not generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods used to improve ANN generalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to use an architecture just barely wide or deep enough to fit the data. The idea here is that smaller networks are less expressive and thus less able to overfit the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is difficult to know a priori the correct size of the ANN, and it is computationally costly to hunt for the correct size. Given this, other methodologies are used to prevent overfitting and improve ANNs' generalizability. These methodologies, like other techniques that combat overfitting, fall under the umbrella term of \"regularization\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you are asked to regularize a network of a given architecture.\n",
